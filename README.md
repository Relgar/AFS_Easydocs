# AFS_Easydocs
A simple mod to make all of Aftershock's Autodocs safe. This is mostly if you want to play the 'High Tech, Low Life' scenario with a safe autodoc instead of a salvaged one, since the salvaged one still requires you to have a high Medical skill in order to safely remove / install bionics (like Bionic Monster or Bionic Operator).
